สวัสดีค่ะ
For many generations, Thai people have worked towards perfecting
the art of cooking by blending traditional methods
with the evolving nature of nutritional science.
Modern Thai cuisine is the embodiment of a culinary philosophy
that promotes the balance of taste, texture and nutrition.
Thai cuisine incorporates the subtle blending of herbs and spices
to produce imaginative and memorable flavours.
The presentation of Thai food should reflect the nation’s culture
and be aesthetically pleasing and elegant.
At the Thai Rack Glass House, we firmly believe in upholding the traditions
that have propelled Thai food to the forefront of worldwide cuisines.
Our main aim is to provide guests with an authentic dining experience which
is true to the essence of Thai cuisine.
Our motto is ‘to serve’ and we shall always endeavour
to make your visit a truly enjoyable occasion.
ขอบคุณค่ะ
